    "# OVERVIEW\n",
    "\n",
    "# Background: \n",
    "# The 1st Round of the NFL Draft is a phenomenon that can make or break a team's next season.\n",
    "# We will experiment with the theory that if a team did well on Offense and poorly on Defense in the previous season, \n",
    "# then they would use their highest pick on a player that can improve their Defense (or vice-versa)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Goal: Predict whether or not a team will draft an Offensive or Defensive player in the 1st Round of the NFL Draft\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data Points:\n",
    "# Independent Variable: What unit for the position each team drafted in the 1st Round (Offense=OFF or Defense=DEF)\n",
    "# (teams can have multiple 1st round picks)\n",
    "# Dependent Variable: A team's stats and league-wide rankings for the previous season\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:\n",
    "# Bengals 2020 Draft QB=Offense=OFF - Bengals 2019 total passing yards, total rushing yards, turnovers, points for/against, etc.\n",
    "# Bengals 2019 Stats - https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cin/2019.htm\n",
